    This application is built using several powerful technologies:
    
    - **Streamlit**: A Python framework for building interactive web apps with ease. It's used to create the user interface for this application.
    - **OpenAI**: We use OpenAI's models for natural language processing and embeddings. OpenAI's GPT-4 handles the conversational AI capabilities.
    - **ChromaDB**: A vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings. Chroma helps in managing and querying large sets of documents, making it easy to retrieve relevant information.
    - **PyPDF2**: A Python library to extract text from PDF documents, which are uploaded by the user to create collections.
    - **NumPy**: A core library for numerical computations, used to handle embeddings and similarity calculations efficiently.
    - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store structured data extracted from PDFs.

    These technologies together provide a seamless way to upload, manage, and query documents, enabling users to chat with their documents and get insightful answers based on the contents.

            st.markdown(''' 
    The AI interacts with your documents using a combination of **document embeddings** and **semantic search**:

    - **Document Embedding**: Each document you upload is processed to create an embedding (a numerical representation) of its content. This is done using OpenAI's embeddings model, which converts the textual content into a vector.
    - **ChromaDB**: After embedding the documents, the vectors are stored in **ChromaDB**, a database optimized for storing and querying these embeddings. When you ask a question, the AI searches the embeddings for the most relevant documents or document chunks.
    - **Semantic Search**: Using cosine similarity, the AI compares your query's embedding to the stored document embeddings to find the closest matches. This allows the AI to understand context and return highly relevant answers.
    - **GPT-4**: Once the AI identifies relevant documents, it uses **OpenAI's GPT-4** to generate detailed responses by providing the context from these documents.
    - **MongoDB**: Structured data extracted from PDFs is stored in MongoDB, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval of specific information.

    This combination of techniques allows the AI to provide accurate, context-aware responses, making it easier to extract meaningful insights from your documents.

    The application offers a range of features designed to help you interact with and manage your documents:

    - **Manage Collections**: You can create, modify, and delete collections of documents. Collections are groups of PDF files that you upload, which are then indexed for searching and querying.
    - **AI Chatbot Interface**: Once you have a collection, you can chat with your documents using the AI chatbot. The chatbot uses the uploaded documents to answer questions, extract insights, and assist with tasks like summarization, analysis, and more.
    - **Document Upload & Chunking**: The app allows you to upload multiple PDF documents, which are automatically processed, chunked into smaller pieces, and stored for efficient querying.
    - **Semantic Search**: By leveraging **OpenAI embeddings** and **ChromaDB**, the AI can search your documents semantically, not just through keyword matching, giving you context-aware responses.
    - **Real-Time Chatting**: Interact with the AI in real-time as it streams responses, allowing for a more engaging and conversational experience.
    - **MongoDB Integration**: Extract structured data from PDFs and store it in MongoDB for efficient retrieval and querying.

    These features make it simple to manage large volumes of documents and extract meaningful insights with minimal effort. Whether for research, business analysis, or personal use, this tool helps you maximize the value of your documents.

    A **collection** is a group of documents that you can upload and organize in the system. It acts as a container for your data and enables you to interact with the documents through the AI chatbot.

    In this app, we use **ChromaDB** to store and manage collections. Here's a brief overview of how collections work:

    1. **Embedding documents**: 
       - When you upload a document, we extract its text and break it down into smaller chunks (called *chunks*).
       - Each chunk is then converted into an **embedding** using OpenAI's embeddings model. An embedding is a numerical representation of the content in that chunk, which allows us to compare and retrieve relevant information efficiently.
    
    2. **ChromaDB**:
       - ChromaDB is a vector database that stores these embeddings and allows for **similarity search**. When you ask a question, the AI looks for the most relevant document chunks by comparing the embeddings of the question and the document chunks.
       - This process ensures that the AI provides you with the most contextually relevant information when responding to your queries.

    3. **Retrieving Context**:
       - When you interact with the AI chatbot, it uses these embeddings to find the most similar chunks of information from the collection. This is known as **retrieval-augmented generation** (RAG). The AI then combines the context from these chunks to generate accurate and insightful responses.
    
    By organizing your documents into collections, you make it easier for the AI to fetch relevant information and assist you in extracting insights from your data.
